# Release notes for 0.4.0

- Drop support on master for julia `0.4`. Support will be continued for bugfixes on the `release-0.4` branch.
- The OpenCL module contains now a `cl` module so that the common pattern `import OpenCL; const cl = OpenCL` is no longer necessary.
- `cl.call` is replaced by `(q::CmdQueue)(...)`
